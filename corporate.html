          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2 corporatepagetitles ubuntu-bold">Design Elements</h4>
          <p class="ubuntu-light">Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="ubuntu-light">
              A colour scheme (with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website)
              <em>&mdash; see the example below from the BUas brand book:</em>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #A82447;"></span>
                  #A82447
                  <em>Red symbolizes passion and determination within team sports. It represents the proud spirit and competitive drive that athletes bring to the game. In the fast-paced world of team sports, red stands as a timeless emblem of resilience, tenacity and the relentless pursuit of victory.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #4D3699;"></span>
                  #4D3699
                  <em>Since the colour purple is not often the colour of choice within teamsport uniforms or logo's it provides a sense of creativity, innovation, and uniqueness. This colour reflects a willingness to break tradition and embrace individuality, signalling a team's confidence in their identity and capabilities.</em>
                </li>
				   <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #DD9C47;"></span>
                  #DD9C47
                  <em>The yellow color refers to energy and enthusiasm, which is seen as a symbol for team sports, team spirit, and togetherness. It provides a sense of positivity and excitement, which are two characteristics that apply to our platform, TeamUp.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Font choices:</strong> We have used a total of four different fonts throughout the entire project. Initially, we chose two fonts: Blanka and Alibaba. Blanka was used for our logo, titles, and headings, while Alibaba was chosen for subheadings and texts. These are the font we used in our social media campaign for marketing and wanted to pursue with on the website as well. Unfortunately, during the coding of the website, we discovered that we could not easily implement these fonts into Dreamweaver because they are not available as Google Fonts. As a result, we searched for two alternative fonts that still matched our website's style. The fonts we are using on the website are Paytone+One for the titles and headers and Ubuntu light, medium and bold for the sub headers and texts. For the headers, we looked for fonts that are playful as they align with our brand identity. For subheadings and body text, clarity and readability were particularly important considerations as well as the match to our style. </li>
            <li class="ubuntu-light"><strong>User interface patterns:</strong> On our website, we employ a variety of organizational tools such as carousels, grids, and a menu system to streamline navigation and enhance user experience. By utilizing these features, we ensure that all content is easily accessible and well-structured, eliminating any sense of chaos. Carousels provide dynamic and engaging displays for featured content, while grids offer a visually pleasing layout for browsing multiple items at once. Additionally, our menu serves as a centralized hub for effortless navigation, allowing visitors to locate specific information with ease. Together, these elements create a seamless browsing experience, fostering user satisfaction and encouraging exploration throughout our website. </li>
            <li class="ubuntu-light"><strong>The structure of the navigation and content:</strong> Throughout the entire project, our design scheme revolves around the consistent use of boxes with rounded corners, a stylistic choice that not only enhances visual appeal but also promotes a cohesive brand identity. This design element is not limited to our website alone; it extends to our social media content, ensuring a unified and recognizable look across all platforms. Our aim is to create a harmonious visual experience by striking a delicate balance between different colours. Each colour is thoughtfully selected to complement the overall aesthetic while also serving specific purposes on individual pages. Some colours may take on a more dominant role, drawing attention to key elements or calls to action, while others play a supporting role, providing visual hierarchy and cohesion. By employing this approach, we not only maintain a visually pleasing and consistent design but also optimize user engagement and interaction across all facets of our digital presence.  (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>

                <li class="ubuntu-light">We tested on four <strong>participants</strong> in total. After the first two participants, we adjusted some things based on their feedback. Then we tested the other two particpants.
                <li class="ubuntu-light">Our test <strong>setting</strong> was on campus and the participants used one of our laptops and one our phones.
                <li class="ubuntu-light">Our test <strong>protocol</strong> was divided in four parts: <br><strong> 1. Concept Platform </strong> <br>From this we wanted to learn whether the participants understood the concept of the platform just from reading the website content. <br> <li>The task was: "Read through the <strong>about us</strong> page and shortly explain what you think this website is for." </li> <strong> 2. Navigation Website</strong> <br> We let the participants browse through the website to understand if they encountered any difficulties navigating or if there were things that did not make sense to them. We gave them 3 tasks: <br> <li>"Go to the page where you can find your personal match and fill in your information." </li><li>"Go to our Instagram Page."</li> <li>"Go to your Team Profile."</li> <strong> 3. Visuals </strong> <br> After the participants had navigated through the entire website, we asked if the images/fonts/colors in the website were informative and appealing, and if things could be done differently. <br> <li>The task: "Rate the visual appeal of the website from 1 to 5, with 1 being very unappealing and 5 very appealing. " </li><strong>4. Relevance</strong> <br> Lastly, we gave some scenario's to the participants. With these scenario’s we asked them if they could indicate whether they would use the website to adress to problem, and if they could explain why they would or why they would not. The scenario's were: <br> <li>"Imagine you are in a soccer team but your team has a different coach every time because there aren’t enough coaches in the club. Would you like to have a permanent coach and would you consider to use a platform like TeamUp to find one?"</li> <li>"Imagine you want to join a sports team, but don’t know where to start searching and how to reach out to sports teams. Would you consider to use a platform such as TeamUp to find teams and connect with them?" </li> </li> </li> </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="ubuntu-light">Our testing <strong>results</strong> were the following:
<ul>
            <br><strong>Participant 1 (Taris) tested on laptop</strong><br>
            From our first participant these conslusions are made:
	
		<li>The participant was able to understand and explain the concept and goal of the platform after reading the ‘about us’ page. </li> 
            <li>The participant was able to understand and explain the concept and goal of the platform after reading the ‘about us’ page. </li> 
            <li>He was also able to easily find the matchmaker page and fill in his information.</li> <li>He was able to find the link to our instagram page. </li>
<li>However, he struggled with finding the team profile page. He wasn’t able to find the profile logo on the right until we helped him. But other than that he was able to find the rest. </li> <li>For the overall visual he gave a 3 out of 5, because he wasn’t a fan of the colors and some pages where overwhelming him with information. </li> <li>For the relevance he mentioned that he does think it can be a helpful tool for players/coaches/teams to find new connections. </li> <br><strong>Feedback on Improvement:</strong> <li>He mentioned that we should move the profile logo more to the left so it is more visible. </li><li>He also suggested a review page from teams with photos or videos from their experience. </li> <li>For the visual he gave the matchmaker page as an example to improve and said that the part of ‘suggested matches’ and ‘found matches’ is confusing and it might be better to put them on seperate pages.</li> 
	<br><strong>Participant 2 (Liz) tested on laptop</strong> <br>From our second participants these conclusions were made: <li>Again the participant was able to understand and explain the concept of the platform by reading the vison and values on the ‘about us’ page. </li> <li>She was again also able to easily find and fill in the matchmaker page.  
<li>She also found the instagram page link quickly.</li> 
<li>Like participant one, she was also not able to find the profile page logo on the right without our help. She didn’t have any other difficulties navigating through the website besides that.</li> <li>For the visual appeal she gave a 4 out of 5 and mentioned that she finds the colors and fonts fitting with the brand identity. She especially liked the ‘chat’ page lay-out. </li>
	<li> For the relevance she said that this website is a good solution to help solve the problems that teams/players/coaches have.</li><br><br><strong>Feedback on Improvement:</strong>  <li>Again to change the profile logo more to the left, so its more visible. </li> <li> To maybe change the layout of the ‘about us’ page because it was simple and static compared to the other pages.</li>  <br><br><strong>Conclusion from the first to participants:</strong> <br>After testing these participants, we decided to make the changes they suggested before testing the other two participants in order to understand if the improvements helped. So, we changed the profile logo more to the left of the navigation bar, in order to make it more visible. We also changed the lay-out of the ‘about us’ page, by adding images and placing the text differently to make it less static and overwhelming.  <br><br><strong>Participant 3 (Yoana) tested on laptop</strong><br>From our third participant these conclusions were made: <li>The third paticipant was also able to understand and explain what they think the platform is for.  </li> <li>This participant was also able to go to the matchmaker page and fill in her information. </li>
<li>She found the instagram link also very quickly. </li>
<li>She was able to find the team profile page as well. </li>
<li>She didn’t have any difficulties navigating through the pages and mentioned that everything is straightforward an that it is nice that the pages can be found from wherever you are on the website.</li> <li>She rated the website a 4 out of 5. She found that the visuals were nice and followed a nice and consistent color pallete.  Also that it had friendly and playful fonts. </li> <li>She mentioned that she found the website very useful and would definetely use the platform if she had problems with finding a team.</li> <br><br> <strong>Participant 4 (Kalijn) tested on phone</strong> <br> From our last participant these conclusions were made: <li>Our last participant was also able to understand and explain what she thinks the concept of the platform is, after scrolling through the website and reading the ‘about us’ page. </li> <li>Like our third participant she was able to complete all the tasks mentioned before. </li> <li>She didn’t experience any other navigating difficulties and it made sense to her. </li> <li>She also rated the website a 4 out of 5, because some things weren’t perfectly aligned yet. </li> <li>Finally, she also mentioned that she would use the platform if she were in any of these scenario’s and thinks the website would be helpfull for team sport players. </li> <br><br><strong>Feedback on Improvement:</strong> <li>Her feedback on improvement was mostly regarding the alignment of text and images of some pages.</li>
<br><br> <strong>Final Conclusion</strong> <br>After the improvements we made from the first two testings, we can conclude that the given feedback on improvement was very useful, since the last two participants didn’t experience problems with finding the team profile page and the style of the 'about us' page. They both showed a thorough understanding of the platform's objectives and idea. They navigated the website and completed the tasks with ease. They found the website's visuals nice, for its dependable color scheme and user-friendly, and only pointed out a few small alignment problems. The two participants expressed that they would make use of the platform, if they would ever experience these problems within team sports. Overall, their comments indicate that the website provides a user-friendly experience and successfully conveys its goal. 
In conclusion, from the four testings we were able to identify some problems and solve those.

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5 corporatepagesubtitles paytone-one-regular">Marketing</h2>
<p class="ubuntu-light">References can be found in the Appendix Section.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2 corporatepagetitles ubuntu-bold">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Context of campaign and message: </strong> 
		  <p class="ubuntu-light">We have launched a promotional campaign for our new website, TeamUp. TeamUp is designed to connect team sport enthusiasts who encounter challenges such as difficulty in joining a new team due to lack of connections or knowledge. Additionally, we provide assistance to clubs and teams in finding the missing puzzle pieces to complete their team. </p>
          <p class="ubuntu-light">With TeamUp we envision a world in which everyone’s unique talents would be appreciated and valued. Where our community would be your one-stop destination for finding like-minded individuals and building lasting relationships. Playing team sports becomes more than just a hobby; it would be a transformative experience that brings people together, fosters growth, and creates lifelong memories. </p>
		  <p class="ubuntu-light">To promote our services we created a social media campaign on Instagram and Facebook to firstly create awareness among our target audience. Our target audience are Males and Females from The Netherlands between 20 and 25 years old. They are teamsport enthusiasts and are active on social media platforms such as Instagram. Their favorite brands are often sport related brands like Nike, Adidas, Puma and Asics. After raising awareness, our goal is to capture their interest by offering substantial information about TeamUp's values, mission, and vision. In the third week, we transition to the desire phase. Here, we illustrate the practical applications of the site and its inclusivity, focusing on specific sports content. In the final phase of the campaign, our aim is to prompt the audience to take action by visiting our website, in addition to engaging with our social media pages. In general, our aim is to address the target group with a motivational tone of voice, inspiring them to take action and become actively involved. Ultimately, we encourage them to take the decisive step of joining a team or finding their ideal teammate to achieve optimal results.  </p>
			<p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Objectives:</strong> 
				<p class="ubuntu-light"><em>Reach objectives:</em> Since we are starting from scratch with our social media accounts, it is not yet possible to reach a high number of reach and followers. We will need to build this up over the course of the month by sharing our content and engaging with our target audience. According to Lanier (2023) it is also important to optimize your account and provide a professional look and feel. Therefore, we are setting a goal of 500 accounts reached for now and 100 followers. While it may be challenging, it is certainly achievable. </p>
		  <li class="ubuntu-light">Increase brand awareness among the target audience within The Netherlands by reaching 500 accounts on social media within one month, 1st of April. </li>
			<li class="ubuntu-light">Increase following among the target audience within The Netherlands by reaching 100 followers on Instagram and 50 followers on Facebook by the 1st of April. </li><br>
			<p class="ubuntu-light"><em>Affect objectives:</em> Our ultimate goal with this platform is to create an environment where like-minded team sports enthusiasts can support each other and form a community. We aim to make a strong start toward this goal in the first month by establishing the initial framework of the community. </p>
			<li class="ubuntu-light">By April 1st, we aim to create a community for individuals interested in team sports, providing connections for players and trainers to join teams or for teams to find new members. We want them to feel welcome in any team sport.</li><br>
			<p class="ubuntu-light"><em>Response Objectives:</em> To assess the effectiveness of our social media efforts, we aim to measure the number of website clicks. This will provide us with insights into the activity of our target audience. Using this data, we can make adjustments to our strategies in the future.</p>
			<li class="ubuntu-light">We want our target audience to join this platform and get in contact with each other to help each other. By the 1st of April we hope to have at least 50 website clicks. </li><br>
		  <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Media Tactics:</strong> 
		  <p class="ubuntu-light">Since our target audience mostly uses Instagram, and Facebook we want to use those platforms to promote our brand. That way we will hopefully reach the maximum amount of people.  
We also hope to partner up with local sports clubs in the Netherlands, collaborating on social media to promote our platform to their members. Positioning ourselves as a solution to finding players and trainers. </p>
		  		  <p class="ubuntu-light"><a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/221866_buas_nl/ETbftldAtVdFlVKRwu6J9rYB7HLS06OUbbq8Yl2rrBZpvQ?e=cyp1tt">Content Calender TeamUp - Month 1.xlsx </a></p>
		  <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Instagram:</strong> Instagram will be our main promotional platform, given its visual appeal and popularity among our target audience. We'll share engaging content like photos, videos, and stories showcasing team sports' spirit and our platform's benefits, aiming to attract users in the Netherlands through relevant hashtags. According to a survey of marketers, the best times to post on Instagram are 6 PM to 9 PM and 12 PM to 3 PM. These time slots tend to have higher engagement rates. Additionally, Fridays are considered the best day to post on Instagram (Needle, 2023) </p>
		  <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Facebook:</strong> Facebook, despite its older user base, remains essential for connecting with a wide audience, including sports clubs. We'll establish a brand page to share updates, events, and user content, engaging with relevant groups to expand our reach.  On average, the best times to post on Facebook across industries are in the evening and mid-to-late afternoon, specifically between 6 and 9 PM and 12 PM - 3 PM. (Needle, 2023)  </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4 corporatepagetitles ubuntu-bold">Learning Points</h4>
          <p class="ubuntu-light">During the execution of our campaign, we faced a few obstacles. One of these obstacles came from the "realness" of the project. In the beginning we found it difficult to post and promote dedicatedly about something that ultimately does not end up on the market. This also made it difficult to actually gain followers. The reason for this could be because we felt comfortable mentioning that this was a school project in our bio, which could turn people off. Another obstacle we encountered was realizing, after a few weeks, that we had made the wrong choice by opting for Facebook instead of TikTok. Despite our hopes of reaching a different segment of the target audience, we fell far short of the envisioned engagement especially on Facebook. After the pitch we adjusted some of our objectives. We added the objective “Increase following among the target audience within The Netherlands by reaching 100 followers on Instagram and 50 followers on Facebook by the 1st of April.”, we did this to also focus on gaining followers and not only reaching accounts. 
		  <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Weekly Reflections:</strong> 
		  <p class="ubuntu-light"><em>Reflection Week 1 - Awareness:</em> During the first week, we were really finding our way with posting content and copywriting. It didn't go too badly, and we reached 30 followers and 61 accounts. The first week was mainly about raising awareness, which meant that we had to reach as many accounts as possible. In the future, if we have to start a similar campaign, we will begin sooner with reels for example, because they are what will help us reach a larger audience. Besides that, we need to focus more on Facebook and be more active on that platform instead of only posting the content.  </p>
			<p class="ubuntu-light"><em>Reflection Week 2 - Interest:</em> After week 2 we reached 56 followers and 1000+ accounts. We noticed that posting reels works really well to reach accounts, so this is what we wanted to continue with in the following weeks. We were happy with how we were doing at that point because we doubled our followers as well. During this week we focused on posting content that provides information about who we are, what we stand for and what the concept is.  </p>
		  	<p class="ubuntu-light"><em>Reflection Week 3 - Desire:</em> The third week was about desire. This meant that we really needed to be clear about what it is that we are offering. We posted content about different sports specifically to attract the attention of a more niche target audience per post. We did this by continuing posting reels, and once again, they proved to be effective. One reel received 1,192 views, while another received 2,280 views. Thanks to the success of these reels, we reached over 2,500 accounts. However, our follower count remained stagnant at 57.   </p>
		  <p class="ubuntu-light"><em>Reflection Week 4 - Action:</em> During our last week, we announced the launch of our website and focused more on gaining followers and increasing website clicks. We were really asking the audience to have a look at our website and motivate them to check it out. We noticed that gaining more followers was very challenging in the final week. However, we were fortunate to have gained some followers and ended up with a total of 66. Another goal for this week was to maximize the number of accounts reached, so we prepared some reels for that. Unfortunately, those reels didn't perform as well as the previous ones. While we did reach more accounts, it wasn't as many as we had hoped. In the end, we reached a total of 2,847 accounts. </p>
		  <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Data and statistics after 1 month:</strong>

		  <p class="ubuntu-light"><em>Did we reach our objectives?:</em> For our Reach objective the goal was to “Increase brand awareness among the target audience within The Netherlands by reaching 500 accounts on social media within one month, 1st of April.” We have more than achieved our goal! Presently, we have reached 2847 accounts on Instagram and 337 accounts on Facebook, totalling a combined reach of 3184 accounts across both platforms. Thanks to Instagram's contribution, we've vastly surpassed our target, indicating that our intended audience is more readily accessible on that platform. While there's room for improvement on Facebook, we're making significant progress." </p>
	      <p class="ubuntu-light">Our second reach objective was to “Increase following among the target audience within The Netherlands by reaching 100 followers on Instagram and 50 followers on Facebook by the 1st of April.” Unfortunately, we fell short of achieving our goal. We have discovered that while reaching accounts is relatively easy, convincing them to follow us is a much greater challenge. Despite making significant strides on Instagram, gaining 100 followers in a month proved to be quite challenging. Facebook, on the other hand, didn't come close to meeting our goal. This can be partly attributed to our lesser focus on Facebook, as we quickly realized that our target audience is more easily reachable via Instagram. </p>
		  <p class="ubuntu-light">For our affect objective our goal was “By April 1st, we aim to create a community for individuals interested in team sports, providing connections for players and trainers to join teams or for teams to find new members. We want them to feel welcome in any team sport.” We found out that achieving this goal wasn't very doable due to the time of the launch of the website at the end of the first month. Additionally, building a community within such a short timeframe proved to be challenging, as the audience needs time to experience what the platform offers and understand its value to them.  </p>
		    <p class="ubuntu-light">For our response objective “We wanted our target audience to join this platform and get in contact with each other to help each other. By the 1st of April we hope to have at least 50 website clicks.” Although we haven't reached the targeted number of website clicks, we're making excellent progress with 38 clicks within just one week. Since the link to our website was only published in the last week we're optimistic about further growth.  </p>
		  <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Improvements in the future / Conclusion:</strong> 
		  <p class="ubuntu-light">In conclusion, our campaign journey has been a rich learning experience. We navigated challenges around promoting a platform without a physical product and discovered the importance of social media platform selection and creating content. Adjusting objectives post-pitch helped us refocus on achievable goals and prioritize follower engagement. Weekly reflections underscored the effectiveness of reels in expanding our reach, yet also highlighted areas for improvement, particularly in platform selection and content strategy. Despite obstacles, our campaign yielded promising results, especially on Instagram.  </p>
		   <p class="ubuntu-light">Moving forward we could consider not mentioning in the biography that the account is for a school project, but only mention it when people are really asking about it. This way we could reach a higher following instead of only the reach itself. For our platform choices next time, we need to conduct more thorough research. We should prioritize focusing on one segment of the target audience at the same time, which also means including TikTok from the start. Additionally, we learned that each platform operates differently and requires different content and pacing. Therefore, we should focus on each platform separately to determine how to maximize its potential. </p>
		  
			
			
 </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 corporatepagetitles ubuntu-bold">Future Planning</h4>
          <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Reflection:</strong> 
		  <p class="ubuntu-light">During our campaign, we encountered both positive and negative outcomes from which we learned a great deal. What went particularly well was the implementation of reels from the second week on; this will certainly be a strategy we continue to use. Moving forward, we should conduct more research on reels to better understand how they function and what content resonates best for broader reach. Additionally, we plan to incorporate TikTok into our media planning and content calendar, as it offers an easy platform for raising awareness and reaching a larger audience. We need to step up our game on Facebook. It's essential to investigate the differences in content compared to Instagram and prioritize engagement with Facebook groups and sports club accounts.</p>
		 <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Communication and Media plan:</strong> 
		  <p class="ubuntu-light">If this project were to continue, our primary focus would be on expanding our reach. We plan to utilize TikTok, among other platforms, as it's a new avenue for us. Additionally, we aim to adjust our approach on Facebook by posting more relevant content that aligns better with the platform's audience. This includes establishing stronger connections with sports clubs. On Instagram, we intend to maintain our current strategy, with a particular emphasis on reels, while also analyzing their effectiveness to see what works and why. Our overarching goal is to foster a community that assists one another with issues such as finding missing players, trainers, and coaches in team sports. We aspire to convey a message of motivation and support to our target audience. </p>
		 <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Objectives:</strong> 
		<p class="ubuntu-light"><em>Reach objective: </em> We aim to prioritize expanding our follower base as part of our reach objective. Observing promising progress on Instagram this month, we anticipate further growth. However, since Facebook remains a challenge, we will maintain the current target for the upcoming month. As we are new to TikTok, we have set a modest goal of 100 followers to measure its reception among our audience. According to Strapagiel (2024) small accounts grow with an average of 4% the first month. Since we start from scratch, we can't attach a number to that yet, thats why we start with a goal of 100 followers </p>
		<li class="ubuntu-light">Increase following among the target audience within The Netherlands by reaching 200 followers on Instagram, 50 followers on Facebook and 100 followers on TikTok by the 1st of May. </li><br>
		<p class="ubuntu-light"><em>Affect objective: </em> In the first month, we established this objective already; however, due to our unfamiliarity with the platform within our target audience, we fell short of reaching it. Therefore, we're targeting this goal for the following month. We already created awareness and gained some followers. We believe this goal is now more attainable given our improved understanding and traction on the platform.</p>
		<li class="ubuntu-light">By May 1st, we aim to create a community for individuals interested in team sports, providing connections for players and trainers to join teams or for teams to find new members. We want them to feel welcome in any team sport.  </li><br>
		<p class="ubuntu-light"><em>Responsive objective: </em>The number of website visitors varies greatly from site to site and is influenced by various factors. Currently, we can only estimate the numbers based on the first month and anticipate an increase in visitors over time. After one week, we have reached 38 website visitors. Using this as a benchmark, we aim for at least 100 visitors by the end of the recommended month. It's commonly understood that the initial weeks are most impactful in terms of growth, with subsequent increases typically being less substantial. (How Many Visitors Do Startup Websites Get?, z.d.) </p>
		<li class="ubuntu-light">We want our target audience to join this platform and get in contact with each other to help each other. By the 1st of May we hope to have at least 100 website clicks. </li><br>
		
		
          <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Media Tactics:</strong> 
		  <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Instagram:</strong> We will continue using Instagram as our main promotional platform, given its visual appeal and popularity among our target audience. We'll share engaging content like reels about different sports, posts with information and call to action to our website and stories for additional content with short messages. </p>
		  <p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Facebook:</strong> Although we did not reach the maximum result with Facebook, we will keep on using the platform but in a different way. We will look into creating more suitable and different content than we have now. Our focus will go more towards the sport clubs and connect with their Facebook platforms and look into collaborations with them. This way we hope to reach more people and have more engagement. </p>
		<p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>TikTok:</strong> We noticed that we missed an opportunity by not using TikTok from the start. TikTok is a beneficial platform for engagement. We will create short, fun videos that highlight the thrill of team sports and advertise our platform as a resource for players and coaches. Content you could think of are videos about different sports but also interactive videos with sports teams. Determining the best times to post on TikTok can be challenging, but after analyzing several sources the optimal times and days are overall in the early afternoon around 1 PM or 2 PM or in the early evening around 7 PM. The best days to post are Tuesdays and Fridays. (Needle, 2023) </p>
		<p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Content Calendar:</strong> We created a content calendar based on findings, reflections, and adjustments we want to make in the upcoming month. You will see that we added TikTok to the calendar and outlined the changes we want to implement for Facebook. While there will be some overlap in content, we aim to make it more specific per platform. For TikTok, this means making our content more interactive by involving hosts and sport club members in the videos. On Instagram, we will continue posting content similar to what we have been doing, as we've seen positive results from it. On Facebook, our focus will shift towards highlighting sport clubs and collaborating with them. </p>

          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4 corporatepagetitles ubuntu-bold">Professionalism</h4>
          <p class="ubuntu-light">In order to make our content coherent, we developed a corporate identity at the beginning of this project that we implemented on both the social media platforms and our website. It is good to maintain a specific style so that viewers will eventually recognize it and link it to your platform. Below you will find screenshots per platform with an explanation of the content .</p>
			<p class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Instagram:</strong> We've been highly active on Instagram to achieve optimal results. We've organized our content into different designs to ensure variety while maintaining a cohesive aesthetic. Our posts feature our values, motivational quotes, and specific sports that we highlight each time. We've aimed to maintain consistency between our posts and stories to create a sense of recognition. Additionally, our reels showcase a variety of sports to enhance our overall image. Additionally, we aimed to keep our copy playful. At times, we needed to provide more information than others, but we strived to keep it powerful and motivating to convey our enthusiasm. </p>
