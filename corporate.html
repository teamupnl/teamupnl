          <ul>
            <li class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Our goals for the test report were the following:</strong> <br> 1. Participants find the website visually appealing. <br> 2. Participants understand from the website what the concept of our platform is and what problems we are trying to solve. <br> 3. Participants can easily navigate through the website and find the needed information. <br> 4. Participants would use the website if they experienced these problems. </li>
            <li class="ubuntu-light"><strong>Our testing methods for the test report were the following:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li class="ubuntu-light">We tested on four <strong>participants</strong> in total. After the first two participants, we adjusted some things based on their feedback. Then we tested the other two particpants.
                <li class="ubuntu-light">Our test <strong>setting</strong> was on campus and the participants used one of our laptops and one our phones.
                <li class="ubuntu-light">Our test <strong>protocol</strong> was divided in four parts: <br><strong> 1. Concept Platform </strong> <br>From this we wanted to learn whether the participants understood the concept of the platform just from reading the website content. <br> <li>The task was: "Read through the <strong>about us</strong> page and shortly explain what you think this website is for." </li> <strong> 2. Navigation Website</strong> <br> We let the participants browse through the website to understand if they encountered any difficulties navigating or if there were things that did not make sense to them. We gave them 3 tasks: <br> <li>"Go to the page where you can find your personal match and fill in your information." </li><li>"Go to our Instagram Page."</li> <li>"Go to your Team Profile."</li> <strong> 3. Visuals </strong> <br> After the participants had navigated through the entire website, we asked if the images/fonts/colors in the website were informative and appealing, and if things could be done differently. <br> <li>The task: "Rate the visual appeal of the website from 1 to 5, with 1 being very unappealing and 5 very appealing. " </li><strong>4. Relevance</strong> <br> Lastly, we gave some scenario's to the participants. With these scenario’s we asked them if they could indicate whether they would use the website to adress to problem, and if they could explain why they would or why they would not. The scenario's were: <br> <li>"Imagine you are in a soccer team but your team has a different coach every time because there aren’t enough coaches in the club. Would you like to have a permanent coach and would you consider to use a platform like TeamUp to find one?"</li> <li>"Imagine you want to join a sports team, but don’t know where to start searching and how to reach out to sports teams. Would you consider to use a platform such as TeamUp to find teams and connect with them?" </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="ubuntu-light">Our testing <strong>results</strong> were the following:
<ul>
            <br><strong>Participant 1 (Taris)</strong><br>From our first participant there are a view conclusions we made:  <li>The participant was able to understand and explain the concept and goal of the platform after reading the ‘about us’ page. </li> 
            <li>He was also able to easily find the matchmaker page and fill in his information.</li> <li>He was able to find the link to our instagram page. </li>
<li>However, he struggled with finding the team profile page. He wasn’t able to find the profile logo on the right until we helped him. But other than that he was able to find the rest. </li> <li>For the overall visual he gave a 3 out of 5, because he wasn’t a fan of the colors and some pages where overwhelming him with information. </li> <li>For the relevance he mentioned that he does think it can be a helpful tool for players/coaches/teams to find new connections. </li> <br><strong>Feedback on Improvement:</strong> <li>He mentioned that we should move the profile logo more to the left so it is more visible. </li><li>He also suggested a review page from teams with photos or videos from their experience. </li> <li>For the visual he gave the matchmaker page as an example to improve and said that the part of ‘suggested matches’ and ‘found matches’ is confusing and it might be better to put them on seperate pages.</li> <br><strong>Participant 2 (Liz)</strong> <br>From our second participants there are a view conclusions we made: <li>Again the participant was able to understand and explain the concept of the platform by reading the vison and values on the ‘about us’ page. </li> <li>She was again also able to easily find and fill in the matchmaker page.  
<li>She also found the instagram page link quickly.</li> 
<li>Like participant one, she was also not able to find the profile page logo on the right without our help. She didn’t have any other difficulties navigating through the website besides that.</li> <li>For the visual appeal she gave a 4 out of 5 and mentioned that she finds the colors and fonts fitting with the brand identity. She especially liked the ‘chat’ page lay-out. </li>

            </ul>
